This is an alternate car paint reflect shader.

Unlike the prevoius release, shader effect is drawn as a second layer.
This way we can just add the reflection to the gtasa graphics effect.
The reflection is based on screen source, giving an illusion 
of realtime reflection - similar to what is seen in ENB.
