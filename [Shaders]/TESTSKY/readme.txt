Description:
I've seen a cool and simple skybox mod for GTASA
http://playmods.blogspot.com/2012/12/skybox.html
I wanted to convert it and ended up with this.

So the skydome texture I have taken from this mod.
Everything else is made from scratch.

Basically it's a static skydome/skybox. Instead of a big
cubemap file you can add a single compressed jpg texture.
